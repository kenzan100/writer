# WHY?
I want to do outputs using my iPhone interfaces.
I want to write a blog article, using the smartphone keyboards effectively.

# WHY not Notes?
I have realized that if my workflow is as follows, the quality of my writing improves with more chances of self-reviews.

1. Write a chunk of sentences.
2. Separate view for writing a new chunk.
3. Separate view for editing an existing chunk.
4. You can add a chunk in between existing chunks(also on top, and at the bottom).
5. You can easily reorder the chunks.
6. You can group a series of chunks into an article with a title.
7. You can list articles
8. An article is given the same capabilities as you can do in draft chunks.
9. You can view an article in a easy to copy-paste format.

# What’s the goal?
To have the above in an usable state asap.
To maintain the codebase so that improving on them is easy.
To maintain the data store so that presenting this to my friends is easy.

# What’s the initial workflow?

* AWS Backend
    * RDS Postgres
    * Lambda
    * API Gateway
* Web app SPA
    * Backbone/Marionette
    * MobX

My personal experiences, and leverage the current work experience at CM(frontend).
